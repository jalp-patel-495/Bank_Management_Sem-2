# 🏦 Bank Management System

Bank Management System is a Java console-based application that simulates basic banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
This project is created as a semester project to demonstrate OOP principles and fundamental banking workflows.

## 📌 Project Overview

This Bank Management System allows the user to:

✔ Create a bank account  
✔ Deposit money  
✔ Withdraw money  
✔ Handle loans  
✔ Manage fixed deposits  
✔ Different user roles such as User, Staff & Bank Manager

The system is built in **Java** and focuses on clean, modular, readable code based on OOP principles. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Inheritance** – for extending base account functionality  
- **Encapsulation** – using private variables with getters/setters  
- **Polymorphism** – method overriding  
- **Enum** – for defining different account types :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🚀 Features

✔ Create and manage customer accounts  
✔ Deposit funds  
✔ Withdraw funds  
✔ Loan management  
✔ Fixed Deposit handling
